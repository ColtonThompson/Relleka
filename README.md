# Relleka-Website

This is a website created for a private server community for RuneScape. This website served as a portal to connect the community together and serviced features such as news, leaderboards and community forums.

# Languages & Tools Used

This was developed using [Brackets](http://brackets.io) and written in a mixture of PHP, HTML and CSS.
There is no framework used for this project and was written from scratch except for Bootstrap.

This uses Bootstrap for scaffolding and a modified CSS for the theme.

# Why was this made?

This website served as a home for the Relleka community where people could visit the site get the latest information and updates on the project as well as talk with other members of the community. The site featured a leaderboard, a forum and other various pages to showcase what the project was about. This site  ran for about 6 months before having to be shutdown due to the game server being closed. 

# What is something you are proud of with this project?

This project made me proud because it is a complete website (albeit a bit bare art wise) that worked and functioned without any major issues during its time being hosted. This also was my first bootstrap project and I understand why a lot of websites during the time of development but also even today utilize this framework for CSS.
